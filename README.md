# NEOPHOBE

Because new things can be scary.


Neophobe is a chrome extension that warns you when you open a webpage that contains a password-style 
input on a domain that you haven't explicitly whitelisted yet. That's it! The hope is, if you're used to
typing your password into `https://example.com`, and someone sends you a malicious phishing email with 
a link to `https://examp1e.com`, Neophobe can help you notice that the letter "l" has been replaced
with a numeral "1" before you give your password over to an attacker.
